I signed up ZOOM pro plan at this time last year.
It recently expired, so I signed up again.
Since I have opportunities to have meetings with friends, it isn't convenient to have the meeting end in 40 minutes.
It seems we will be using ZOOM for a while longer, so I decided to re-sign up for a one-year plan.

I used these three tips to get a cheap ZOOM plan.
1. Buy the 1-year subscription.
2. Pay in US Dollars.
3. Use a coupon code.

As a result, I paid $123.66 in total.
It's not cheap, but I think worth it.
Also, I don't go to the convention in these few years, I don't have to pay the cost of transportation, gas and hotel. so that, I can save the money.
I can use the money left over for ZOOM plan.

At this time next year, I'm wondering we will still be using ZOOM or not.
